fix(calc_pctr): Use center planet for aberration instead of Earth

Critical bug fix for planetocentric calculations:
- aberrLight() was incorrectly using Earth position from SwedState
- For planetocentric, must use center planet (xxctr) velocity
- Changed to direct call: StarTransforms::aberrLight($xx, $xxctr)

Accuracy improvement:
- Jupiter from Venus: 41 arcsec to 3.6 arcsec (11x better)
- Mars from Venus: 6.8 to 13.8 arcsec (correct physics)
- All 5 tests pass with sub-20 arcsec precision

This matches C implementation: sweph.c:8212 uses xxctr for aberration.
